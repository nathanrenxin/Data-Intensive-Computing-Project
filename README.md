# Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data for Prediction of Stock Movements

Twitter is a social network where people post short, 140-character, status messages called tweets.
Because tweets are sent out continuously, Twitter is a great way to figure out how people feel about
current events. For example, how people feel about the presidential candidates, how people feel about
a movie to predict box office. In this project, we created a program that enables us to find out how
people feel about Apple and its products thus to predict its stock movements.

We applied sentiment analysis on tweets. The total positive, negative and neutral emotions in tweets in
a 4 hours period are calculated successively to predict the movement of next hour stock price. Then we
compared the prediction with data from Yahoo finance to evaluate the accuracy of the program.
